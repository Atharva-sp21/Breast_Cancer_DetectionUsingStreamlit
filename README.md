# Logistic Regression Web App

A simple and interactive **Machine Learning web application** built with **Streamlit** that uses a **Logistic Regression** model to make predictions.  
The application also uses **Plotly** for interactive visualizations and **Pickle** for model storage and loading.

## 🚀 Features

- **Logistic Regression Model** for binary/multiclass classification
- **Streamlit Web Interface** for easy user interaction
- **Plotly Graphs** for dynamic, interactive data visualization
- **Pickle** for saving and loading the trained model
- Real-time prediction based on user input
- Responsive and clean UI
